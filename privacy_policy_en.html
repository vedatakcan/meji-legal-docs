<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we, Meji ("we," "our," or "us"), handle your information when you use our mobile application, Meji (the "Application").</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not collect or store any personally identifiable information</strong> such as your name, email address, or contact details.</p>

<p>Your game progress and preferences are stored locally on your device. This data is never sent to any external server.</p>

<p>We may collect limited, non-personal data automatically for app functionality and advertising purposes, including:</p>

    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Such as device model, OS version, and language settings, used to improve compatibility and user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> A unique identifier used by advertising platforms to serve personalized ads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>
<p>We use third-party services to display advertisements, which helps us offer the Application for free. These services may collect and process certain data for personalized ad delivery.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We use Google AdMob for our advertising needs. Google AdMob works with a variety of third-party advertising partners to display ads. These partners may collect and use data to provide a better advertising experience. For more information on how Google and its partners handle your data, you can review their privacy policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a></li>

<p>In accordance with privacy regulations, we use a consent management platform (CMP) to inform you about the data processing by our advertising partners and to obtain your consent. You can manage your preferences for these partners at any time through the in-app privacy settings.</p>

<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any other parties outside of these services.</p>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>
<p>All gameplay data is stored locally on your device and cannot be accessed by us. Data collected by third-party services is handled securely by those providers in accordance with their own policies.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
