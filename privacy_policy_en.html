<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 21, 2025</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Meji</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles your information when you use our mobile application, Meji (the “Application”). By using the Application, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
    We do <strong>not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information</strong> (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or contact details.
</p>

<p>
    All gameplay progress, scores, settings, and preferences are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> via a Room database. This data is never uploaded to any server and cannot be accessed, restored, or viewed by the Developer.
</p>

<p>We may collect limited non-personal information automatically for functionality, analytics, and advertising purposes, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, language settings, and performance data, used solely to improve compatibility and app performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> Used by Google AdMob for delivering personalized and non-personalized ads. You may reset or disable this ID in your device settings at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Google AdMob</strong> – Used to display advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers, app interactions, and advertising data.
        You can review their privacy policy here:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, transfer, or share your data with any external parties, except as required by the third-party service listed above.
</p>

<h3>Google Play Billing and Data Safety</h3>

<p>
    Purchases and subscriptions made within the Application are processed securely through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>, which is operated entirely by Google. All payment-related information—such as purchase history or payment method identifiers—is handled and stored only by Google, and is never accessible to the Developer.
</p>

<p>
    For more details about Google’s data handling practices, you may refer to their official resources:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/11416267" target="_blank">Google Play Billing – Privacy & Security Information</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469" target="_blank">Google Play Data Safety Program</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    In compliance with Google Play requirements, the Application accurately discloses any data types that may be collected by the app or by third-party SDKs (such as an advertising ID or device information) through the Data Safety form submitted to Google Play.
</p>

<p>
    Changes to Google Play’s policies or data processing practices are managed directly by Google. If necessary, the Application’s Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect such changes.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>

<p>
    Your gameplay data is stored securely on your device only. If you delete or reinstall the Application, or if your device malfunctions, your data may be permanently lost. The Developer cannot retrieve, recover, or restore your local data under any circumstances.
</p>

<p>
    Any data collected by third-party providers (such as AdMob or Google Play Billing) is handled by them in accordance with their own security and privacy practices.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Remains on your device until you uninstall the Application or manually delete app data.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Data:</strong> Retained according to the policies of the respective third-party service providers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
    The Application is suitable for general audiences and does not contain harmful or inappropriate content. However, we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13 (or applicable age thresholds under local laws).
</p>

<p>
    Because no personal information is collected by the Application, we comply with global child privacy principles, including COPPA.
</p>

<p>
    Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise the usage of the Application by minors.
</p>

<h2>6. International Users</h2>

<p>
    The Application is available worldwide. Your device data may be processed by third-party services operating in multiple countries under their respective legal frameworks.
    By using the Application, you acknowledge that your non-personal data may be processed outside your country of residence.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will take effect immediately upon posting. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
